THANKS
------

I'd like to thank GNOME project. I learn a lot from its code and some pieces were used in fbpanel. Correct for version 3.0, systray code and wm icon code were copied from GNOME

Credits and lot of thanks to Peter Zelezny <zed@linuxpower.org> an author of fspanel (see http://www.chatjunkies.org/fspanel/ or http://freshmeat.net/projects/fspanel/). The first version of fBpanel was started as hacking around fSpanel :-)

Nice battery icons for battery meter plugin were taken from http://rocketdock.com/addon/docklets/9523
